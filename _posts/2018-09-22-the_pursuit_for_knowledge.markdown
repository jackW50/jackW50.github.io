   It started in a Barnes and Noble. On that particular day, I was in need to kill some time, so I decided to aimlessly wander around the store. I causally strolled around looking to see if anything would catch my eye. I scanned the new releases, ran through the mystery, then ended up at the science section. I eyed each subject and weighed my interest level. Starting at Anthropology and ending at Zoology, then back again. On my second go round, I was drawn to the computer science section for some odd reason. Odd, because I’ve never had  any interest in that arena before. So as naive as I was, I glanced over each book one by one not knowing what to think. I picked up a few and briefly ran through some of their pages. Everything I looked at was foreign. I felt out of my element. This was the very first time I realized I knew absolutely nothing about the very thing I use everyday of my life.

	This fact troubled me. Everyday I interact with software—read articles, watch videos, conduct business, etc. This idea of interacting with something on a daily basis and not understanding it, even on some sort of basic level, gave me a weird feeling. How could I know so little about something that I use so much? It was an eye-opening revelation. I never gave much thought to it, but it was like coming to realize that you know nothing about the very person you’ve shared almost half your life. The very thing that knows so much about me, had me clueless as to what they were about. This feeling inspired me to enter the world of software development.

	 My curiosity was officially sparked. I wanted to know what was behind it all. What made the interaction with software possible? Lots of questions flooded my head, and I figured it was better late than never. Needless to say, I purchased a couple of beginner-type books, and after finishing them, I felt an urge for more. Why just dip your toe into the ocean? I grasped the basics, and accomplished what I wanted to accomplish, but for some reason I didn’t feel like I was finished. I felt as if I had only just begun. For me a spark was lit, but rather than resolving, it grew into a flame. These books sparked my curiosity, and led me down the path for more knowledge.
